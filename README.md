# WEAF - a Whole-Enterprise Architecture Framework

This repository contains documentation for WEAF, a whole-enterprise architecture framework.

## Overview

WEAF provides a standards-aligning unified enterprise model, an ecosystem covering business assurance concerns, and a requirement specification methodology which enforces traceability.

The framework is intended to advance the practice of enterprise architecture, business analysis, and software/system engineering.  
* WEAF is an answer to the grand challenge of ubiquitous traceability<sup>[1](#1)</sup>.  
* WEAF enables the “preferred path”<sup>[2](#2)</sup> for portability and interoperability.  
* WEAF fulfills the need for an assurance ecosystem that addresses assurance across the enterprise and throughout the lifecycle.

A basic overview can be found in the [WEAF Overview](./WEAF-overview.pdf).  A sketch of construction and usage is available in [WEAF-construction-and-usage.odp](./WEAF-construction-and-usage.odp).  A detailed summary that covers the essential components of WEAF is available in [WEAF Detailed Summary](./WEAF-detailed-summary.odp).
